# Ember Service Worker Asset Cache

**[ember-service-worker-asset-cache is built and maintained by DockYard, contact us for expert Ember.js consulting](https://dockyard.com/ember-consulting)**.

_An Ember Service Worker plugin that caches an Ember app's asset files_

By default it caches all files in the `assets` folder.

## F#$& my assets aren't updating in development mode

Turn on the "Update on reload" setting in the `Application > Service Workers`
menu in the Chrome devtools.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-service-worker-asset-cache
```

## Configuration

You can configure extra files to include and if your app's file are on a CDN,
you can configure the CDN url.

The configuration is done in the `ember-cli-build.js` file:

```js
const EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app')

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    'asset-cache': {
      // which asset files to include, glob paths are allowed!
      // defaults to `['assets/**/*']`
      include: [
        'assets/admin-engine.js',
        'fonts/font-awesome.*'
      ],

      // which asset files to exclude, glob paths are allowed!
      exclude: [
        '**/*.gif'
      ],

      // manually include extra external assets
      manual: [
        'https://cdn.example.com/foo-library.js'
      ],

      // Changing this version number will bust the cache, but you probably do not
      // want to be doing this manually, but rather using `versionStrategy` as
      // explained here http://ember-service-worker.com/documentation/configuration/#versioning
      version: '1',

      // if your files are on a CDN, put the url of your CDN here
      // defaults to `fingerprint.prepend`
      prepend: 'https://cdn.example.com/',
      
      // mode of the fetch request. Use 'no-cors' when you are fetching resources
      // cross origin (different domain) that do not send CORS headers
      requestMode: 'cors',

      // Prevent errors (status of 400 or greater) on a single file
      // from not updating other files that have no issues
      lenientErrors: false
    }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```

*Note that setting `requestMode` to 'no-cors' will have some drawbacks, like not being able to distinguish between
successful and failed responses. Use it only when needed.*
